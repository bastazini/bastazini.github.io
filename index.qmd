::: {#hero-heading}

I am an ecologist with a broad (and when I say broad, I mean broad!) interest in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology, but my main interest lies in understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics and its consequences to patterns of biological diversity and species interactions. I address these kinds of questions by combining aspects of phylogenetics, network and functional ecology, using species traits as a biological building block to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics and their consequences to ecological communities and ecosystems services.

"*What physicists view as noise is music to the ecologist*" 
(Daniel Simberloff 1980)
