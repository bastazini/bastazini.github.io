::: {#hero-heading}

I am an ecologist with a broad (and when I say broad, I mean broad!) interest in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology, but my main interest lies in understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics and its consequences to patterns of biological diversity and species interactions. I approach these topics by integrating theoretical and analytical concepts from Phylogenetics, Functional Ecology, and Complex Networks, using species traits as a biological building block to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics and their consequences to ecological communities and ecosystem functioning.

"*What physicists view as noise is music to the ecologist*" 
(Daniel Simberloff 1980)
